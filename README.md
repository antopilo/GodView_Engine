This is a engine made using the Godot engine. It is meant to be used for top down games. It is also currently under development by *Antoine Pilote* and *Emeryc Primeau*. It is fairly new still, but a lot more is planned. We won't support this engine, so if you plan to use this, you've been warned.

## Planned features

At this stage there is a LOT to still to implement. but here is what is planned so far. Note : This can change during development.

## Editor

We are planning to do an in-game editor that supports tiled based editing, and node based editing. We also want to be able to Save the levels in a human readable format like JSON. We will also have per-level environment settings, for example Lighting, Mood, Theme, etc.

## Player

We have a simple Player Controller. Since player movement is always unique per game. We don't want to make a full fledged player controller, but still have some basic elements, like spawning, changing levels and what not(will change).

## Levels

Levels will support multiple layers that can customized, Godview support levels as big as you want! You can either make small rooms or big open worlds that are inter-connected however you want them.

more will come in the future :)
