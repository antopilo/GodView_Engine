<h1 align="center">GodView Engine</h1>

This is an engine made using the Godot engine. It is meant to be used for top down games. It is also currently under development by *@antopilo*, *@emerycp* and *@cadinsl*. It is fairly new still, but a lot more is planned. We won't support this engine, so if you plan to use this, you've been warned.

## Installation
GodView_Engine is a Godot project on its own. It is currently being developped on the 3.1 Version. To install, simply import the project.godot file in the Godot Launcher and the then opening the project with godot will get you started. There is also a C# Solution in the same folder, simply open it with your favorite IDE to start coding.

## Usage
We don't recommend any use of our engine yet. It is still under developpement and is not functionnal yet. Stay away for now. If you are still curious about the engine, you can read the wiki for more info on how it works. Here is the link: https://antopilo.github.io/GodView_Engine/

## Credits
There are only 3 developers working on the project part-time. We are both full-time students that have part-time jobs, meaning that we don't have all the time in the world to work on this. We are @antopilo , @emerycp and @cadinsl.

## License
Since this is a tool that we work on for fun. You can do whatever you want with it. Credits are appreciated.
