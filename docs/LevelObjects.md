# Level Objects

A level by itself doesn't do much. It needs objects to become alive. There are two types of object. Visible and non-visible objects. Believe it or not, the most important types out of the two is non-visible. The reason is simple, what makes a level work is non-visible objects. You can have a level that is completely transparent but still be able to walk in the level without any problem, it would simply be very ugly and boring, but you can't play level if it doesn't have a Spawn, checkpoint or other meta-related objects.The goal of these non-visible objects(also called nodes) is to give our game systems some data to work with. For example Spawns positions are fed into the Spawn system. We don't want any logic coded into the level itself. the game is going to handle it by itself.
